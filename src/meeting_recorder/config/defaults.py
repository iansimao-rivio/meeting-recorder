SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = """\
You are a meeting assistant. Given the following meeting transcript, produce concise, \
well-structured meeting notes in Markdown format.

The transcript may include speaker labels (e.g. **Speaker 1:**, **John:**). \
Where speaker labels are present, reference speakers by name or label when attributing \
decisions and key points.

Structure the notes as follows:
1. A brief summary of the meeting (2-4 sentences).
2. Key discussion points and decisions, attributed to speakers where identifiable.
3. If and only if there are clear action items mentioned in the meeting, add an \
## Action Items section at the very end. List each item as a checkbox with the owner \
if known (e.g. `- [ ] John to send the report by Friday`). \
If there are no action items, omit this section entirely — do not write "None".

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}
"""

GEMINI_TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT = """\
Transcribe this audio recording exactly as spoken.

Label each speaker turn with a timestamp and speaker label on a new line, for example:

[00:00:05] **Alice:** Hello, can everyone hear me?
[00:00:09] **Bob:** Yes, loud and clear.

Rules:
- Try to infer each speaker's name from the conversation (e.g. if someone is addressed \
by name or introduces themselves). Use that name as their label.
- If a name cannot be determined, label speakers as **Person 1:**, **Person 2:**, etc., \
assigned in the order they first speak. Use the same label consistently for the same speaker.
- Start each new speaker turn on a new line.
- Timestamps should be in [HH:MM:SS] format, incremented roughly every turn.
- Transcribe faithfully in whatever language is spoken; do not translate.
